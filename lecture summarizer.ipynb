But this isn't water\", \"I'll do it in purple\", \"I don't want it to be that thick. So let me draw the oceanic crust-- is thinnerthan the continental crust, whichI'm trying to depict right over here. So this right over here is oceanic crust,and up here is continental crust. And the thickness, or how deep you can go and stillbe in crust, it depends on where you are\", \"And we know that near hot spots, the oceanic crust can actuallythin out a good bit. But roughly, when we talk about the crust,we're talking about something that's30 to 60 kilometers deep. So 30 to 60 kilometers deep. So if you are on a continent, whichI'm assuming you are, and you dig for 20 kilometers,you will still be in the crust\", '30 kilometers, probably still in the crust', \"If you dig for 70 kilometers or 100 kilometers,you will probably reach the mantle. And remember, what we're describing here,when we talk about the crust, the mantle, and the core,we're talking about the chemical makeup\", 'Let me make this clear', \"We're talking about the chemical makeup\", \"The crust is fundamentally different than the mantle basedon the molecules that it is made up of,based on its composition. So let's talk about the mantle now. So the mantle, layer like this. And once again, this is not to scale because the crust,we're talking about 30 to 60 kilometers\", \"The mantle, we're talking about on the orderabout 2,900 or 3,000 kilometers thick. So this right here is the entire mantle. So that's the mantle. And this is 2,900 to 3,000 kilometers thick. So this isn't even 1/30 of that. So I would have to draw it even narrower than the wayI've drawn it over here\", 'And the mantle itself can be subdividedinto the upper mantle and the lower mantle. So let me draw this division right over here', \"The upper mantle, and there's different waysto define the boundary\", 'The upper mantle is roughly about 700 kilometers down. So these are huge distances', 'I mean, this is going straight down. So this is the upper mantle', 'Let me write it on the actual mantle here', 'This is the upper mantle, and this over hereis the lower mantle. And just to be clear on things. So the crust is solid', \"Now when you go into the upper mantle,the upper part of the upper mantle-- and we'lltalk about that a little bit more--is cool enough to be solid. So there is a solid portion of the upper mantle. So all of this up here is solid because it's cool enough. It hasn't reached the melting point of those rocks just yet\", \"And we learned in previous videosthat the combination of the solid part of the upper mantleand the crust combined, we call that the lithosphere. And when we talk about the lithosphere,we're not talking about the mechanical makeup\", \"We're not talking about what's solid and what's not solid. So this is the lithosphere\", 'You go a little bit deeper', \"Right below the lithosphere, now the temperaturesare high enough for-- and I use the word liquid,but that's not exactly right\", \"You can kind of think of it as kind of a deformable solid,or a plastic solid or a magma. And that's the asthenosphere. So this area right over here, this area rightover here, the liquid part-- actually, Ishouldn't use the word liquid. It deforms over long periods of time. But it is more fluid than what we normallyassociate with rock magma, would be a good wayto think about it\", \"That's what we call the asthenosphere. It is fluid, just not as fluid as water. It is more viscous than something like water. So this is the asthenosphere\", \"Now the upper mantle, it's hot enoughfor the rock to melt and be fluid. And the pressure is low enough for itto still be able to kind of move past itself,to still be somewhat fluid. But then once you get even deeper, into the lower mantle,you have higher pressure. And so it's still fluid, but it's less fluid\", \"It's kind of thicker-- I guess, is the bestway to think about it-- in the lower mantle, it's thicker. So this whole area over here, you could kind ofthink of it as melted rock. But the upper part of the melted rock is more fluid\", \"It's able to move easier, because there's less pressure. And the pressure's just from all of the rock that's above it\", 'Remember, gravity is pulling down on everything', \"Every molecule here wants to go downward because of gravity. So it's applying pressure downward. So the deeper you go, the more pressure you get\", 'Now, when we get even deeper than that, we get to the core,and the core is divided between the outer coreand the inner core. So the outer core and then, of course,you have the inner core. And just so we have a sense for the distances,the width or the thickness of the outer coreis approximately 2,300 kilometers', 'So these are huge distances, when you think about thickness', \"You could go down another 2,300 kilometers,and you're in the-- or once you go through the mantle,you can go 2,300 kilometers to the outer core. And then you're in the inner coreand that essentially takes you to the rest\", \"That's essentially the center of the earth. And the inner core-- Maybe I shoulddraw the boundaries a little bit more to scale\", 'Let me do it this way. It should actually look a little bit morelike this, because the outer coreis thicker than the inner core. So the outer core is, as I said, let me rewrite it', \"Outer core is on the order, it's about 2,300 kilometers thick. And then you have your inner core\", \"I shouldn't do it in blue\", \"I should do it in a hot color. So the inner core right over herejust kind of takes us to the center of the earth. And that's a little over 1,000 kilometers thick. So this is the inner core\", 'The number I have is about 1,200 kilometers thick. And both the-- the entire core, both the outer coreand the inner core, is mainly nickel and iron', 'Think about when the earth was forming', 'What happens is when this whole earth was super hotand was kind of in a fluid state,the heavier elements were allowedto sink down, when everything was fluid', 'The things that were in between would kind of--or the things that were lighter would go up. And then the gases, things that would naturallybe in the gaseous state, would kind ofbubble up through that fluid, kind of the way,actually, carbon bubbles up in a soda,it would eventually bubble out of the fluid,and it would actually form the atmosphere', \"So that's why, when you look at the composition of the earth,you have the densest, the heaviest elements,at the center. And then the lightest elements are forming the atmosphere. And the outer core and the inner core, theyare made up predominantly of nickel and iron. And their makeup is actually very similar\", 'So this division-- Chemically, theyhave a very similar composition', \"What's different about them is at the outer core,you have temperatures high enoughthat nickel and iron can melt. But the pressures are low enough that they can stillbe in a fluid state. So this is our liquid outer core. And this has a pretty low viscosity,especially even relative to the mantle\", \"So that's why people kind of considerthis in kind of a more traditional liquid state. But as you get deeper and deeper and deeper,the pressure becomes so huge as youget to the inner core-- remember all of the weight of allof the rock above you, of these thousands of miles of rockabove you, is all pushing down on the rock below it\", \"So the inner core, even though the temperature is really,really, really hot, the pressure is so bigthat the molecules can't flow past each other\", \"They can't be liquid\", \"They're kind of jam-packed. And so the inner core, because of the high pressure,despite the high temperature, is solid. So the difference here is actuallya mechanical one between the outer core and the inner core\", \"They're made up of the same things, roughlythe same chemical makeup\", \"It's just slightly-- or lower pressure on the outsideso you can actually be in a fluid state.

And Vitamin C is water soluble', \"Now the reason why this might be relevant for you,living as an individual, trying to keep your healthin good shape, is that you do need all of these vitamins,and we'll talk in a little bit about why you need them,but fat soluble vitamins, they're actually easierto overdose on, because they're soluble in fat,they can stay in your system a lot longer,while water soluble vitamins are easierto flush out of your system\", \"Now, with that out of the way, let's think about someof these common foods you might see,and some of the vitamins that they are known for\", 'For example, right over here you have carrots,and you might have had people tell you,\"Hey, eat carrots', '\"It\\'s good for your eyes', '\"And that is true, but the reason whyit\\'s good for your eyes,is that carrots contain something known as betacarotene,and the carotene part of betacarotene is not a coincidence.

It gives the carrot this orange color right over here,and betacarotene, once it\\'s consumed by your body,it\\'s a precursor for Vitamin A,which is essential for your eyesand many, many other things in your body', \"And a precursor's just a very fancy way of sayingthat if you consume betacarotene, you're body canturn it into the Vitamin A that it needs\", \"Oranges, famous for Vitamin C, and this isn'tan exhaustive list of things that these foods contain,but this is some of the things that they're most famous for,and Vitamin C as we talked about is a water soluble vitamin\", \"It's very valuable for immune system,and in a situation where you have a severe deficiencyof Vitamin C, you could get a disease known as scurvy.

And the thickness, or how deep you can go and stillbe in crust, it depends on where you are\", \"And we know that near hot spots, the oceanic crust can actuallythin out a good bit.

So this is the upper mantle', 'Let me write it on the actual mantle here', 'This is the upper mantle, and this over hereis the lower mantle. And just to be clear on things. So the crust is solid', \"Now when you go into the upper mantle,the upper part of the upper mantle-- and we'lltalk about that a little bit more--is cool enough to be solid. So there is a solid portion of the upper mantle. So all of this up here is solid because it's cool enough. It hasn't reached the melting point of those rocks just yet\", \"And we learned in previous videosthat the combination of the solid part of the upper mantleand the crust combined, we call that the lithosphere.

But it is more fluid than what we normallyassociate with rock magma, would be a good wayto think about it\", \"That's what we call the asthenosphere. It is fluid, just not as fluid as water. It is more viscous than something like water. So this is the asthenosphere\", \"Now the upper mantle, it's hot enoughfor the rock to melt and be fluid.

And so it's still fluid, but it's less fluid\", \"It's kind of thicker-- I guess, is the bestway to think about it-- in the lower mantle, it's thicker.

            "I'll label it with the symbol p. And it's equal to the product of the mass times the velocity. This is something you've undoubtedly seen before. Now, let's think about the dimensionsof momentum for a moment. So dimensionally, momentum has unitsof mass times the velocity. And so that's in SI units, the units of mass are kilogramsand then the units of velocity are meters per second. You can also express momentum dimensionallyas a product of a force times time. And so, again in SI units, units force are the Newtonand the units of time is the second. So these are the SI units for momentum, two different waysof writing the same dimensions. Now, we've seen that for a single particle,we can write Newton's second law as the force isequal to the mass times the acceleration. Or equivalently, we can write thatas the mass times the time derivativeof the acceleration, dv/dt. Now, if m is a constant, then I can rewrite this as Fis equal to the time derivative of the mass times the velocity,or equivalently as the time derivative of the momentum,since mv is just equal to p. So I actually want to stress this much--I'm going to put it in a box because it'svery important that I can write Newton's second law,instead of F equals ma, as F equals the timederivative of the momentum. And this is absolutely where we'llsee the momentum becomes very useful. Because it turns out that this form of Newton's second lawis actually the most general form of the equationbecause it's applicable not just to a single point mass,but also to a more complicated system. A system consisting of many massesor a system where the masses changingor the masses flowing, as in a fluid. In all of those cases, this form of Newton's second lawis correct. F equals ma, which is probably more familiar to you,is actually a special case of this law for the caseof a single point mass. So this is where we'll see that momentum is quitea useful concept, especially as we start consideringmore complicated systems, as we'll get to a little laterin the course. What I want to do now though, is to take a closer lookat this equation, force is equal to the time derivativeof the momentum. Whenever we have a relation involvinga derivative like this, we can always alsorewrite it in an equivalent integral form, whichcan be very useful and give us a different way of lookingat the same information. So let's take a look at that. So if I take this equation and integrate both sideswith respect to time, then I can writethat as the integral of F with respect to timeis equal to the integral of the right-hand side,dp/dt with respect to time. Now, let's make this a definite integral. I'll go from time t1 to time t2 on both sides here. Now, this right-hand side is just--so the integral of dp/dt with respect to timeis just p at time2 minus p at time1. And that is just the change in the momentum vectorgoing from time1 to time2. Now, this integral on the left-hand side,we give a special name. We call this the impulse. This name, impulse, calls to mind a short, sharp, shockof some sort. But it can also refer to a weak forceacting over a long interval. And notice here the function F, the force F,is in general a function of time. So this doesn't necessarily mean a constant f. This could mean a force that's varying in time. And what this equation tells us isthat the change in the momentum of the systemdoesn't depend on the detailed time dependence of F,but rather just on the integral of F. And so suppose I were to graph the force as a function of timegoing from time0 to a time delta t. And suppose I had some complicated function thatlooked like that. The impulse is just the area under this curve. It's the integral of this function. And the change in the momentum dependsonly on the area under this curveand not on the detailed shape of the curve. So what that means is that I can define an average forceby choosing a constant force thathas the same area as this example on the left. So suppose I calculated that. And there is some constant force here. I'll call this F average. Going over the same time interval. The average force is that constant forcewhich has the same area as the area under my F of t. So in other words, F average times delta t,which is the area on the right-hand side here,is equal to the integral of F of t dt integratedfrom 0 to delta t, which is the areaunder this right-hand curve. And so my average force is just that integral, F of t dt,divided by delta t. And this is integrated from 0 to delta t. So that's my average force\n"
